This is a project I completed in my university's "Topics in Game Development"
course, in spring 2025. We were able to choose our own project topic, and I chose to learn about
shaders. This project is completed in Godot engine 4.4, and features a few different
shaders, utilizing both vertex and fragment shaders.

Included is a short write-up I did when submitting the "Final video showcase" to my
instructor, detailing what each shader was, and how it was done. That write-up can be
found as "ShadersWriteUp.pdf".

Additionally, the (very messy) source code and project file can be found in its own folder.
My initial understanding of the project for the course was that we were supposed to make an actual
game, using the topic we had chosen. Because of this, many of the scripts, objects, scenes, materials,
etc are entirely unused, because they either didn't pan out as expected, or were made for the purpose
of creating gameplay. After speaking with my instructor and understanding that project's g rade would *only*
revolve around my implementation of shaders, and the learning done, my focus shifted entirely to the shaders
themselves.

After completing the project, I didn't spend much time cleaning up the project, or source
code. This is because I ended up moving on to other projects that I wanted to begin, after
what I had learned about shaders, graphics programming, and rendering.

Lastly, pre-exported builds of the "showcase" scene can be found in the "Linux" and "Windows" folders.
This showcase area was used to show off the major shaders detailed in the write-up.
Movement is simply handled using WASD, and camera control is done with the mouse.
Additionally, an options menu can be accessed using ESC, to turn on/off the different screen-space effects,
and to modify some of their values.
